# Brain Teasers

The following are some brain teasers that I have come across. I will add more as I come across them.

## 1. Two Ropes that take 1 hour to burn

You have two ropes and a lighter. Each rope burns in 1 hour. How do you measure 45 minutes?

> Solution: Light both ends of one rope and one end of the other rope. When the first rope is burnt out, light the other end of the second rope. When the second rope is burnt out, 45 minutes have passed.

## 2. Nine balls, one heavier

You have nine balls. One of them is heavier than the others. You have a balance scale. How do you find the heavier ball with only two uses of the scale?

> Solution: Divide the balls into 3 groups of 3. Weigh two of the groups and leave the third group aside. If the two groups are equal, the heavier ball is in the third group. If one of the groups is heavier, the heavier ball is in that group. Do the same with the 3 balls in the heavier group. You will have found the heavier ball in two uses of the scale.
