# Brain Teasers

The following are some brain teasers that I have come across. I will add more as I come across them.

## 1. Two Ropes that take 1 hour to burn

You have two ropes and a lighter. Each rope burns in 1 hour. How do you measure 45 minutes?

> Solution: Light both ends of one rope and one end of the other rope. When the first rope is burnt out, light the other end of the second rope. When the second rope is burnt out, 45 minutes have passed.

## 2. Nine balls, one heavier

You have nine balls. One of them is heavier than the others. You have a balance scale. How do you find the heavier ball with only two uses of the scale?

> Solution: Divide the balls into 3 groups of 3. Weigh two of the groups and leave the third group aside. If the two groups are equal, the heavier ball is in the third group. If one of the groups is heavier, the heavier ball is in that group. Do the same with the 3 balls in the heavier group. You will have found the heavier ball in two uses of the scale.

## 3. The heavy pill

You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once.

> Solution: Put 10 bottles on each side of the scale. The heavier side has the heavier bottle. Now remove one bottle from each side until the scale is balanced. The last bottle removed from the heavier side is the heavier bottle.
>
> Solution 2: Number the bottles from 1 to 20. Take 1 pill from bottle 1, 2 pills from bottle 2, 3 pills from bottle 3, and so on. Weigh all the pills together. The difference between the actual weight and the expected weight is the number of the bottle with the heavier pills.

## 4. Dominos on a chessboard

You have a chessboard and 31 dominos. The chessboard will have two diagonally opposite corners cut off. Each domino covers two squares on the chessboard. Can you cover the chessboard using all the dominos?

> Solution: No. Each domino covers one white square and one black square. The chessboard has 30 white squares and 32 black squares. Therefore, it is impossible to cover the chessboard using all the dominos.

## 5. Jugs of water

You have a five-quart jug (1.25 gallons), a three-quart jug (0.75 gallons), and an unlimited supply of water. How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? (You can't measure the half jugs)

> Solution: Fill the 5-quart jug. Move 5-quart water to 3-quart. Dump 3-quart water. Fill 3-quart with 5-quart water (2-quart). Fill 5-quart. Fill 3-quart with 5-quart water. Done! You have 4 quarts in the 5-quart jug.
